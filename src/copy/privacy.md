Welcome to the Hyperscale website (including all subdomains and community communications systems, the "Site" and/or "Service"), which is operated by \[Corporate Entity\] and its affiliates (collectively, "Hyperscale", "Company", "we", "us" and/or "our").

This Privacy Policy explains what Personal Information (defined below) we collect, how we use and share that data, and your choices concerning our data practices. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and forms part of our Terms of Service.

By using the Site, you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, please do not access the Site or otherwise use the service.

1\. PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT

We collect information that alone or in combination with other information in our possession could be used to identify you ("Personal Information") as follows:

Personal Information You Provide: We may collect Personal Information when you create an account, join our community communications systems, subscribe to our communications, sign up for an event, or communicate with us as follows.

Discord Information: If you create a Discord profile, we may collect your username (please note that references to your username in this Privacy Policy include your ID or another username that you are permitted to create in connection with the Site, depending on the circumstances), password, email address (only if you choose to provide it), the date you created your account, any information you choose to provide in your profile, and any submissions or comments that you have posted to Discord ("Discord Information").

Application Information: If you submit an application for funding or related updates to the Site, Personal Information related to your application will be (i) collected, (ii) processed, (iii) disclosed, and/or (iv) made public. Applications may be reviewed by the public and any information submitted as part of an Application may be published publicly.

We may also disclose your Application Information to service providers, as part of various business transactions (including, but not limited to, merger, acquisition, financing due diligence, reorganization, bankruptcy, receivership, sale of all or a portion of our assets, or transition of service to another provider), as part of certain legal requirements based on good faith, or with your consent.

Due to the large number of applications and related materials that we receive and review, and the similarity of much of the information provided in such applications, we cannot accept responsibility for protecting against misuse or disclosure of any general information, knowledge or other materials (including without limitation any information generally known in your industry) included in your Application Information. Any such general information or knowledge you submit to the Site may be used or disclosed by us or any person with whom we share your application for any purpose and in any manner.

You submit applications at your own risk. We implement commercially reasonable technical, administrative, and organizational measures to protect Application Information both online and offline from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no Internet or e-mail transmission is ever fully secure or error free. In particular, e-mail sent to or from us may not be secure. Therefore, you should take special care in deciding what Application Information you send to us.

After the application process has ended, we may retain your application and the information contained therein.

DAO Race Information: If you participate in the DAO race as an observer and/or voter, we collect information relating to your voting and application review. Your votes are made public.
