## Contributing

Pull Requests are welcome and encouraged! Make an issue first, and create a PR to assign it to yourself. Mark it for review when ready and we'll check to merge it.

Contribution process borrows from [Collective Code Construction Contract](https://rfc.zeromq.org/spec/44/) (C4). Most important points:

* Change on the project shall be governed by the pattern of accurately identifying problems and applying minimal, accurate solutions to these problems.
* The user or contributor should seek consensus on the accuracy of their observation, and the value of solving the problem.
* To work on an issue, a contributor shall fork the project repository and then work on their forked repository.
* To submit a patch, a contributor shall create a pull request (PR) back to the project.
* A contributor shall not commit changes directly to the project.
* To discuss a patch, people may comment on the pull request.
* Maintainers should not merge their own patches except in exceptional cases, such as non-responsiveness from other maintainers for an extended period (more than 1-2 days).
* Maintainers shall not make value judgments on correct patches.
* Maintainers shall merge correct patches from other contributors rapidly.
* Maintainers should ask for improvements to incorrect patches and should reject incorrect patches if the contributor does not respond constructively.
* Any contributor who has value judgments on a correct patch should express these via their own patches.
